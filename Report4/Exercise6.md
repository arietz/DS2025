# Data visualization, pt. 2 (`seaborn`)

## Goals of this exercise

- Introducting `seaborn`. 
- Putting `seaborn` into practice:
  - **Univariate** plots (histograms).  
  - **Bivariate** continuous plots (scatterplots and line plots).
  - **Bivariate** categorical plots (bar plots, box plots, and strip plots).

## Introducing `seaborn`

### What is `seaborn`?

> [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a data visualization library based on `matplotlib`.

- In general, it's easier to make nice-looking graphs with `seaborn`.
- The trade-off is that `matplotlib` offers more flexibility.


```python
import seaborn as sns ### importing seaborn
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## just in case we need it
import numpy as np
```


```python
%matplotlib inline 
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
```

### The `seaborn` hierarchy of plot types

We'll learn more about exactly what this hierarchy means today (and in next lecture).

### Example dataset

Today we'll work with a new dataset, from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/). 

- **Gapminder** is an independent Swedish foundation dedicated to publishing and analyzing data to correct misconceptions about the world.
- Between 1952-2007, has data about `life_exp`, `gdp_cap`, and `population`.


```python
df_gapminder = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder_full.csv")
```


```python
df_gapminder.head(2)
```

## Univariate plots

> A **univariate plot** is a visualization of only a *single* variable, i.e., a **distribution**.

![title](img/displot.png)

### Histograms with `sns.histplot`

- We've produced histograms with `plt.hist`.  
- With `seaborn`, we can use `sns.histplot(...)`.

Rather than use `df['col_name']`, we can use the syntax:

```python
sns.histplot(data = df, x = col_name)
```

This will become even more useful when we start making **bivariate plots**.


```python
# Histogram of life expectancy
sns.histplot(df_gapminder['life_exp']);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_13_0.png)
    


#### Modifying the number of bins

As with `plt.hist`, we can modify the number of *bins*.


```python
# Fewer bins
sns.histplot(data = df_gapminder, x = 'life_exp', bins = 10, alpha = .6);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_15_0.png)
    



```python
# Many more bins!
sns.histplot(data = df_gapminder, x = 'life_exp', bins = 100, alpha = .6);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_16_0.png)
    


#### Modifying the y-axis with `stat`

By default, `sns.histplot` will plot the **count** in each bin. However, we can change this using the `stat` parameter:

- `probability`: normalize such that bar heights sum to `1`.
- `percent`: normalize such that bar heights sum to `100`.
- `density`: normalize such that total *area* sums to `1`.



```python
# Note the modified y-axis!
sns.histplot(data = df_gapminder, x = 'life_exp', stat = "probability", alpha = .6);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_18_0.png)
    


### Check-in

How would you make a histogram showing the distribution of `population` values in `2007` alone? 

- Bonus 1: Modify this graph to show `probability`, not `count`.
- Bonus 2: What do you notice about this graph, and how might you change it?


```python
pop2007 = df_gapminder[df_gapminder['year'] == 2007]

sns.histplot(data=pop2007, x='population', bins=50)

# Bonus 2
# Raw count histogram is extremely right-skewed. 
# Possibly switching to a different scale could make the bulk of countries much more distinguishable.
```




    <Axes: xlabel='population', ylabel='Count'>




    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_20_1.png)
    



```python
sns.histplot(data=pop2007, x='population', bins=50, stat='probability')
```




    <Axes: xlabel='population', ylabel='Probability'>

## Bivariate continuous plots

> A **bivariate continuous plot** visualizes the relationship between *two continuous variables*.

![title](img/seaborn_relplot.png)

### Scatterplots with `sns.scatterplot`

> A **scatterplot** visualizes the relationship between two continuous variables.

- Each observation is plotted as a single dot/mark. 
- The position on the `(x, y)` axes reflects the value of those variables.

One way to make a scatterplot in `seaborn` is using `sns.scatterplot`.

#### Showing `gdp_cap` by `life_exp`

What do we notice about `gdp_cap`?


```python
sns.scatterplot(data = df_gapminder, x = 'gdp_cap',
               y = 'life_exp', alpha = .3);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_25_0.png)
    


#### Showing `gdp_cap_log` by `life_exp`


```python
## Log GDP
df_gapminder['gdp_cap_log'] = np.log10(df_gapminder['gdp_cap']) 
## Show log GDP by life exp
sns.scatterplot(data = df_gapminder, x = 'gdp_cap_log', y = 'life_exp', alpha = .3);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_27_0.png)
    


#### Adding a `hue`

- What if we want to add a *third* component that's categorical, like `continent`?
- `seaborn` allows us to do this with `hue`.


```python
## Log GDP
df_gapminder['gdp_cap_log'] = np.log10(df_gapminder['gdp_cap']) 
## Show log GDP by life exp
sns.scatterplot(data = df_gapminder[df_gapminder['year'] == 2007],
               x = 'gdp_cap_log', y = 'life_exp', hue = "continent", alpha = .7);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_29_0.png)
    


#### Adding a `size`

- What if we want to add a *fourth* component that's continuous, like `population`?
- `seaborn` allows us to do this with `size`.


```python
## Log GDP
df_gapminder['gdp_cap_log'] = np.log10(df_gapminder['gdp_cap']) 
## Show log GDP by life exp
sns.scatterplot(data = df_gapminder[df_gapminder['year'] == 2007],
               x = 'gdp_cap_log', y = 'life_exp',
                hue = "continent", size = 'population', alpha = .7);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_31_0.png)
    


#### Changing the position of the legend


```python
## Show log GDP by life exp
sns.scatterplot(data = df_gapminder[df_gapminder['year'] == 2007],
               x = 'gdp_cap_log', y = 'life_exp',
                hue = "continent", size = 'population', alpha = .7);

plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left', borderaxespad=0);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_33_0.png)
    


### Lineplots with `sns.lineplot`

> A **lineplot** also visualizes the relationship between two continuous variables.

- Typically, the position of the line on the `y` axis reflects the *mean* of the `y`-axis variable for that value of `x`.
- Often used for plotting **change over time**.

One way to make a lineplot in `seaborn` is using [`sns.lineplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lineplot.html).

#### Showing `life_exp` by `year`

What general trend do we notice?


```python
sns.lineplot(data = df_gapminder,
             x = 'year',
             y = 'life_exp');
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_36_0.png)
    


#### Modifying how error/uncertainty is displayed

- By default, `seaborn.lineplot` will draw **shading** around the line representing a confidence interval.
- We can change this with `errstyle`.


```python
sns.lineplot(data = df_gapminder,
             x = 'year',
             y = 'life_exp',
            err_style = "bars");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_38_0.png)
    


#### Adding a `hue`

- We could also show this by `continent`.  
- There's (fortunately) a positive trend line for each `continent`.


```python
sns.lineplot(data = df_gapminder,
             x = 'year',
             y = 'life_exp',
            hue = "continent")
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left', borderaxespad=0);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_40_0.png)
    


#### Check-in

How would you plot the relationship between `year` and `gdp_cap` for countries in the `Americas` only?


```python
sns.lineplot(
    data=df_gapminder[df_gapminder['continent'] == "Americas"],
    x='year',
    y='gdp_cap',
    hue='country'
)
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left', borderaxespad=0);

```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_42_0.png)
    


#### Heteroskedasticity in `gdp_cap` by `year`

- [**Heteroskedasticity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity_and_heteroscedasticity) is when the *variance* in one variable (e.g., `gdp_cap`) changes as a function of another variable (e.g., `year`).
- In this case, why do you think that is?

#### Plotting by country

- There are too many countries to clearly display in the `legend`. 
- But the top two lines are the `United States` and `Canada`.
   - I.e., two countries have gotten much wealthier per capita, while the others have not seen the same economic growth.


```python
sns.lineplot(data = df_gapminder[df_gapminder['continent']=="Americas"],
             x = 'year', y = 'gdp_cap', hue = "country", legend = None);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_45_0.png)
    


### Using `relplot`

- `relplot` allows you to plot either line plots or scatter plots using `kind`.
- `relplot` also makes it easier to `facet` (which we'll discuss momentarily).


```python
sns.relplot(data = df_gapminder, x = "year", y = "life_exp", kind = "line");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_47_0.png)
    


#### Faceting into `rows` and `cols`

We can also plot the same relationship across multiple "windows" or **facets** by adding a `rows`/`cols` parameter.


```python
sns.relplot(data = df_gapminder, x = "year", y = "life_exp", kind = "line", 
            col = "continent");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_49_0.png)
    


## Bivariate categorical plots

> A **bivariate categorical plot** visualizes the relationship between one categorical variable and one continuous variable.

![title](img/seaborn_catplot.png)

### Example dataset

Here, we'll return to our Pokemon dataset, which has more examples of categorical variables.


```python
df_pokemon = pd.read_csv("data/pokemon.csv")
```

### Barplots with `sns.barplot`

> A **barplot** visualizes the relationship between one *continuous* variable and a *categorical* variable.

- The *height* of each bar generally indicates the mean of the continuous variable.
- Each bar represents a different *level* of the categorical variable.

With `seaborn`, we can use the function `sns.barplot`.

#### Average `Attack` by `Legendary` status


```python
sns.barplot(data = df_pokemon,
           x = "Legendary", y = "Attack");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_55_0.png)
    


#### Average `Attack` by `Type 1`

Here, notice that I make the figure *bigger*, to make sure the labels all fit.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,4))
sns.barplot(data = df_pokemon,
           x = "Type 1", y = "Attack");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_57_0.png)
    


#### Check-in

How would you plot `HP` by `Type 1`?


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 4))
sns.barplot(
    data=df_pokemon,
    x='Type 1',
    y='HP'
);

```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_59_0.png)
    


#### Modifying `hue`

As with `scatterplot` and `lineplot`, we can change the `hue` to give further granularity.

- E.g., `HP` by `Type 1`, further divided by `Legendary` status.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,4))
sns.barplot(data = df_pokemon,
           x = "Type 1", y = "HP", hue = "Legendary");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_61_0.png)
    


### Using `catplot`

> `seaborn.catplot` is a convenient function for plotting bivariate categorical data using a range of plot types (`bar`, `box`, `strip`).


```python
sns.catplot(data = df_pokemon, x = "Legendary", 
             y = "Attack", kind = "bar");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_63_0.png)
    


#### `strip` plots

> A `strip` plot shows each individual point (like a scatterplot), divided by a **category label**.


```python
sns.catplot(data = df_pokemon, x = "Legendary", 
             y = "Attack", kind = "strip", alpha = .5);
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_65_0.png)
    


#### Adding a `mean` to our `strip` plot

We can plot *two graphs* at the same time, showing both the individual points and the means.


```python
sns.catplot(data = df_pokemon, x = "Legendary", 
             y = "Attack", kind = "strip", alpha = .1)
sns.pointplot(data = df_pokemon, x = "Legendary", 
             y = "Attack", hue = "Legendary");
```


    
![png](Exercise6_files/Exercise6_67_0.png)
    


#### `box` plots

> A `box` plot shows the interquartile range (the middle 50% of the data), along with the minimum and maximum.

A typical **boxplot** contains several components that are part of its anatomy:

- Median: This is the middle value of the data, represented by a line in the boxplot.
- Boxes: These represent the interquartile range (IQR) of the data, which represents the range between Q1 and Q3. The bottom and top edges represent Q1 and Q3, respectively.
- Whiskers: These are vertical lines that extend from both ends of the box to represent the minimum and maximum values, excluding outliers.
- Outliers: These are points outside the whiskers that are considered abnormal or extreme compared to the rest of the data.
- Limiters: These are the horizontal lines at the ends of the whiskers, representing minimum and maximum values, including any outliers.

**Do the whiskers show the minimum and maximum?**

From a statistical point of view - the ends of the whiskers are therefore not min and max - because they do not contain part of the outliers. 

*Standard rules:*

- **Outliers:** These are points outside the whiskers' range. These values are considered abnormal compared to the rest of the data.
- **Whiskers range:** Whiskers extend to values that are within limits:
  - Lower whisker: $Q1 - 1.5 * IQR$
  - Upper whisker: $Q3 + 1.5 * IQR$
- **Extreme outliers:** If the values are much further outside the whiskers (e.g., $Q1 - 3 * IQR$ or $Q3 + 3 * IQR$), they may be considered extreme outliers.

**Why are outliers important?**

- May indicate errors in data (e.g., typos, measurement errors).
- They may represent real but rare events that are worth investigating.
- Outliers can significantly affect descriptive statistics, such as the mean, so their identification is crucial in data analysis.

**Why 1.5 × IQR?**

$1.5$ × $IQR$ is the standard value used to identify moderate outliers.

The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1), the range within which the middle 50% of the data is located.

Values that fall outside the range:

- Lower threshold: $Q1$ - $1.5$ × $IQR$
- Upper threshold: $Q3$ + $1.5$ × $IQR$ are considered outliers.

The $1.5$ value was empirically chosen as a reasonable compromise between detecting outliers and ignoring natural fluctuations in the data.

**Why 3 × IQR?**

$3$ × $IQR$ is used to identify extreme outliers that are much more distant from the rest of the data.

Outlier values:

- Lower threshold: $Q1$ - $3$ × $IQR$
- Upper threshold: $Q3$ + $3$ × $IQR$ are considered extreme outliers.

The $3$ × $IQR$ value is more stringent and identifies points that are highly unusual and may indicate data errors or rare events.


```python
sns.catplot(data = df_pokemon, x = "Legendary", 
             y = "Attack", kind = "box");
```

Try to consider converting the boxplots into violin plots.

## Conclusion

As with our lecture on `pyplot`, this just scratches the surface.

But now, you've had an introduction to:

- The `seaborn` package.
- Plotting both **univariate** and **bivariate** data.
- Creating plots with multiple layers.
